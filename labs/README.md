Clone this repository and create a local git branch before continuing e.g. git checkout -b labs-yourGitHubUsername

## Creating the flux config for your lab application 

Inside the labs directory, run the [`labs/create-lab-flux-config.sh`](create-lab-flux-config.sh) script to create the flux config needed for your lab application. Use the component name you used when creating your app with backstage, which should be your GitHub username and specify the type of application you are deploying.

<summary>Command to create the flux configuration for a Java app</summary>

```shell
./create-lab-flux-config.sh yourGitHubUsername java
```
</details>

<details open>
<summary>Command to create the flux configuration for a Node.js app</summary>

```shell
./create-lab-flux-config.sh yourGitHubUsername nodejs
```
</details>

The above script will do the following:
- Create the directory that the new config will be created in `apps/labs/labs-'yourGitHubUsername'`
- Create the ImagePolicy and ImageRepository config
- Create the HelmRelease resource to deploy your app 
- Add the image-policy and image-repo file references to the labs automation kustomization file so flux can automate image updates
- Add a reference to the HelmRelease file the sbox kustomization cluster so the resources are 

Once the script has been executed, you will need to create a new branch, add and commit the new config and then push the changes to GitHub. 
- Switch to a new branch by using `git switch -c labs-yourGitHubUsername`
- Run `git status` to check which files have been create and modified.
- Use `git add .` from the root of the repo to stage the changes for commit
- Run `git diff --staged` to view the changes made to the existing kustomization files. You should see references to the newly created files for your lab app.
- When you're happy with the changes made, commit and push them and create a PR.

More information on flux v2, its components and custom resources can be found on [flux docs site](https://fluxcd.io/docs/concepts/).

## Deleting the flux config for your lab application

Once you're finished with your lab app you can clean up the flux configuration by running the [`clean-up-lab-flux-config.sh`](./create-lab-flux-config.sh) script. 

Inside the labs directory run the clean up script to remove the flux config you created earlier.

```shell
./clean-up-lab-flux-config.sh yourGitHubUsername
```

Once the script has successfully finished, you will need to check and then commit the changes and push to GitHub and create a PR.
