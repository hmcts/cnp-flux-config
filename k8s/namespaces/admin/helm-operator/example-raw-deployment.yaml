      # The following volume is for using a customised `known_hosts` file,
      # which you will need to do if you host your own git repository rather
      # than using GitHub or the like. You will also need to mount it
      # into the container, below.
      #
      # You may also wish to provide an `ssh_config` file,
      # mentioning more than one `IdentityFile`; for instance, if you are
      # using more than one GitHub repository. NB: the entry key should be
      # "config" rather than "ssh_config" if mounted in ~/.ssh/.

      # You will need this volume if you are using a git repository that
      # needs an SSH key for access; e.g., a GitHub deploy key. If
      # you are using just one such repository, the default `ssh_config`
      # already points at `/etc/fluxd/ssh/identity` as a key. If you
      # want to use more than one key, you will need to provide your own
      # `ssh_config` above, with an `IdentityFile` entry matching each
      # key in the secret mentioned here.
