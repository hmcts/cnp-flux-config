      morganSpurlock: Born and raised in West Virginia, Spurlock earned a BFA at New York university and created the stunt webcast I Bet You Will in 2002, which subsequently became a TV show. After Super Size Me’s success, Spurlock made Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?, in which he attempted to track down the then-fugitive leader of al-Qaida. He also contributed to the 2010adaptation of Steven D Levitt and Stephen J Dubner’s Freakonomics (with a segment asking if names influence people’s lives) and POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold in 2011, investigating product placement. In 2013 Spurlock released One Direction: This Is Us, a film shot in 3D featuring the British boyband in concert and behind the scenes.
Spurlock also directed the TV show The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice!, shown in 2010. Arguably his most successful TV work was the FX series 30 Days, which ran between 2005 and 2008, in which participants took on an unlikely task or lifestyle, such as a devout Christian living with a Muslim family, or Spurlock himself living on minimum wage.
In 2017 Spurlock published an open letter in which he admitted sexual misconduct and resigned from his production company Warrior Poets.
Spurlock was formerly married to Alexandra Jamieson and Sara Bernstein, and had two sons Laken and Kallen.
