                      description: reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating
                        the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers
                        of specific condition types may define expected values and
                        meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered
                        a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string.
                        This field may not be empty.
